This repository contains a current prototype draft for the FMI Layered
Standard WebAssembly (fmi-ls-wasm) based on the [Functional Mock-up Interface][FMI]
3.0 standard for the exchange of simulation models.
It presents a mapping of the [FMI 3.0][FMI3] C API to the [WebAssembly Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) interface description language (WIT).

Note that this draft is being worked on actively, and thus is subject to change without notice.

This is currently not normative, nor is this document to be considered
officially endorsed by the Modelica Association or other involved
organisations prior to official adoption.

The [FMI 3.0 Layered Standard WebAssembly][spec] is currently maintained on
[GitHub][githubspec] and is published [here][spec]. It is based on
the [FMI][] standard.

Also included are examples show-casing the WIT definitions, using Rust, C and WAT implementations.

## Design decisions

### `fmi3Instance` → three standalone resources

The opaque C pointer is mapped to three distinct WIT resources — one per
interface kind:

| FMU kind           | WIT resource                     | Static factory                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Model Exchange     | `model-exchange-instance`        | `instantiate-model-exchange`        |
| Co-Simulation      | `co-simulation-instance`         | `instantiate-co-simulation`         |
| Scheduled Execution| `scheduled-execution-instance`   | `instantiate-scheduled-execution`   |

Each resource owns the full lifecycle of the FMU instance: it carries the
instantiation factory as a static method, all common lifecycle and variable
access methods (`enter-initialization-mode`, `get-float64`, `set-fmu-state`,
etc.), and the interface-kind-specific methods (`do-step`, `set-time`, …).

Resource ownership is linear: `fmi3FreeInstance` is called when the resource
is dropped, so no explicit free binding is needed.

This design means the host never holds an intermediate `common::instance`
handle: instantiation and all operations go through the single typed resource,
making it impossible to call ME-only methods (e.g. `set-time`) on a CS handle.

### Callback pointers → imported interfaces

FMI 3.0 passes callbacks as function pointers to `fmi3Instantiate*`.  In the
Component Model these become **imported** interfaces supplied by the host world.
The `fmi3InstanceEnvironment` opaque pointer is dropped entirely; the
Component Model's closure semantics handle per-instance context automatically.

### `intermediateUpdateCallback` is optional

The `intermediate-update-callbacks` interface is a separate import so that
simple CS FMUs that do not support early return can omit it.

### Parallel C arrays → `list<T>` / `list<tuple<…>>`

FMI getter/setter functions use parallel C arrays (pointer + size_t length).
These map to `list<T>` in WIT.  Where two arrays are logically paired (e.g.
`vrs[]` + `orders[]` for output derivatives), they are collapsed into
`list<tuple<value-reference, u32>>` to prevent length mismatches.

### Optional parameters → `option<T>`

`fmi3EnterInitializationMode` takes a `toleranceDefined` boolean alongside
`tolerance`, and similarly for `stopTimeDefined` / `stopTime`.  These pairs
collapse to `option<f64>` in WIT, which is both more idiomatic and eliminates
the possibility of passing `toleranceDefined = false` with a non-zero
`tolerance`.

### Output parameters → return values / records

Functions with multiple C out-parameters (e.g. `fmi3UpdateDiscreteStates`,
`fmi3DoStep`, `fmi3CompletedIntegratorStep`) return a record instead of
multiple pointer arguments.  This is idiomatic for WIT and eliminates
null-pointer risks.

### `fmi3FMUState` → `list<u8>`

The C API uses a two-phase serialise approach (`fmi3GetFMUState` +
`fmi3SerializeFMUState`).  The WIT mapping merges these into a single
`get-fmu-state` that returns `list<u8>` (serialised bytes immediately).
The host therefore never holds an un-serialised `fmi3FMUState` handle.

### `fmi3Boolean` → `bool`

FMI 3.0 defines `fmi3Boolean` as `int`-sized (for C ABI compatibility).
The Component Model uses a native 1-byte `bool`, which is correct for WIT.

### `fmi3String` → `string`

FMI strings are null-terminated UTF-8.  WIT `string` is length-prefixed UTF-8;
the null terminator is elided.

### `fmi3Binary` → `list<u8>`

Binary variables carry an explicit length in C (`valueSizes[]`).  In WIT each
blob is a `list<u8>` whose length is intrinsic, so the size array is removed.
For `fmi3GetBinary` / `fmi3SetBinary` dealing with multiple variables the
type becomes `list<list<u8>>`.

| `fmi3Instance`           | `resource model-exchange-instance` / `co-simulation-instance` / `scheduled-execution-instance` | Owned handle; one resource per interface kind |
| `fmi3Status`             | `enum status`     | Five variants                      |
| `fmi3IntervalQualifier`  | `enum interval-qualifier` | Three variants             |
| `fmi3DependencyKind`     | `enum dependency-kind` | Five variants                 |
| Callback function pointer| imported `interface callbacks` | Host-supplied        |

## Known limitations and future work

1. **`fmi3GetVersion` is a free function** — it is the only item in the
   `common` interface, exposed at the interface level rather than as a resource
   method, matching the C API.

2. **Model description XML** — FMI 3.0 ships metadata as `modelDescription.xml`
   inside the FMU archive.  This mapping covers only the runtime API; the
   static metadata is out of scope.

3. **Threading model for SE** — The preemption lock/unlock callbacks are mapped
   as host-imported functions, but the Component Model threading extensions
   (WASI threads or `shared-everything-threads`) are still evolving.  Platform
   integrators may need to adapt when those proposals stabilise.

4. **`fmi3Char`** — Used only in `fmi3GetVersion` return value; mapped to
   `string`.

5. **Serialise/deserialise split** — If round-tripping large state blobs proves
   expensive, the two-phase C API (`GetFMUState` + `SerializeFMUState`) can be
   re-exposed as separate WIT functions without changing the type mapping.
